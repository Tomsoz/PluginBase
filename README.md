# PluginBase Common Library

This is a small **utility library** that I use while creating my own Minecraft plugins.  
It provides some common functionality that I frequently need across projects.

## 📌 About

- This library is **primarily for my personal use** in plugin development.
- Others are welcome to use it, fork it, or learn from it.
- **No official support is provided** — if you use it, you’re on your own.

## 📖 Origin

This project is based on
👉 [Finally-A-Decent/Trashcan](https://github.com/Finally-A-Decent/Trashcan)

I’ve made some of my own additions and modifications to better suit my workflow.

## ⚡ Usage

You can include this library in your own plugin projects if you wish.  
However, since this is not a published dependency, you’ll need to:

- Clone the repository and build it yourself, or
- Copy the parts of the code you find useful into your own project.
